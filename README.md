# Democracy-Data

We use various statistical methodologies and visualizations to see how democracy affects income per capita and vice versa.

[DemoIncomeWrite-Up.ipynb](DemoIncomeWrite-Up.ipynb) has the code and the accompanying write-up for all the visualizations and regressions

The other two files are simply alternatives ways to open the file (though, not being notebooks they are non-interactable)
